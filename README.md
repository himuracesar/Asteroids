Objective
-----------------------------
This project was developed in 2009 with the objective to only learn C++ and OpenGL. The OpenGL version is 2.x or maybe 3. It uses the fixed rendering pipeline yet and it doesn't have shaders.

The window's resolution is small compared with resolutions today, sorry for that.

Sadly I can't upload one asset due to copyright. So you have to replace it. 

The name of the file is:
