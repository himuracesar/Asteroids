Objective
-----------------------------
This project was developed in 2009 with the objective to only learn C++ and OpenGL. The OpenGL version is 2.x or maybe 3. It uses the fixed pipeline yet and it doesn't have shaders.

Sadly I can't upload one assets due to copyright. So you have to replace it. 

The names of the file is:
